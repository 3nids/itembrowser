This plugin allows you to browse a multiple selection in QGIS.

First, connect the layers by clicking the "plug" icons or the corresponding menu entry. Choose the layers to be connected and validate.

Try to select *several* features and see at the bottom left of QGIS a dialog to browse your selection.
Choose the color you want for the selection. Open view/edit form with "pen" icon.


For developers:

If you want something to happen with the selection, the plugin emits two signals as soon as the selection changed:
browserCurrentItem(QgsVectorLayer,QgsFeatureId) if there is a selection
browserNoItem(QgsVectorLayer) if there is nothing selected
