This plugin allows you to browse a multiple selection in QGIS.

First, connect the layers by clicking the "plug" icon or the corresponding menu entry. Choose the layers to be connected and validate.

Select features and see at the bottom left of QGIS a dialog to browse your selection.
You can open the view/edit form with the "pen" icon.

In the settings, you can set the color and width of the rubber band, and the scaling regarding to the bounding box of the current item.

The connected layers info is kept in the project. As soon as you reload the project, the layers are connected.
You can also save the current selection, this is enabled by default. If you are browsing a large selection, it allows you to re-start at the same feature.

Last version can be found at https://github.com/3nids/itembrowser

For developers:

If you want something to happen with the selection, the connected layer emits two signals as soon as the selection changed:
browserCurrentItem(int) if there is a selection
browserNoItem() if there is nothing selected
